[![Up to date Status](https://david-dm.org/anodynos/urequire-example.png)](https://david-dm.org/anodynos/urequire-example.png)

An example project using [urequire](http://urequire.org), [grunt-urequire](https://github.com/aearly/grunt-urequire) & [urequire-ab-specrunner](https://github.com/anodynos/urequire-ab-specrunner).

Provides boilerplate & grunt/urequire config for cross module systems development and cross runtimes deployment.

It comes with tests that run on nodejs, phantomjs and browser (Web/AMD & Web/Script).

## Usage:

### Download and install

```bash

$ git clone anodynos/urequire-example && cd urequire-example

$ npm install && bower install

```

### A full clean build & test.

Run the default build & specs test with `$ grunt`, that builds with UMD & min (combined & uglified) and runs specs on both nodejs & browser.
The HTML specs and all other configs are automagically generated by [urequire-ab-specrunner](https://github.com/aearly/grunt-urequire).

Hit `$ grunt all` to run all specs against all builds!

### Watch file changes (code & specs), rebuilding & running specs *only* when stuff _really_ changes.

```bash

 $ grunt UMD specWatch
          or
 $ grunt min specWatch

```
